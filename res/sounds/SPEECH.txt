Uh, Hello? Hello? Yo what up guys, SlicerVSGaming here, and I'm back with another tutorial!
Basically, Sam's computer isn't working, so he gets to work at Mr. Hendrick's desk!
Your objective is to finish making a program on your graphing calculator!
But you can't program what you don't know.
You have to watch a YouTube tutorial to learn how to program Sam's calculator.
While programming or watching a tutorial, Mr. Hendricks starts to move nearer.
To stop his progression you have to open up netbeans and work for a little bit.
You can switch between work and the tutorial by pressing the X in the top right corner of Hendrick's laptop.
The closer Hendricks is, the more likely he is to notice you programming your calculator.
Also, if you're blatently not doing your work, Mr. Hendricks may charge at you.
To avoid getting detention, you need to put away your calculator and switch to your work before he reaches you.
And on top of that you only have 80 minutes to finish your program, so good luck.
Anyways, thats it for this video, hope you all enjoyed!
